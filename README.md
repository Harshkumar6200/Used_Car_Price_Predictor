# Used Car Price Predictor

## Overview
Used Car Price Predictor is an ML regression project focused on predicting the prices of used cars. The project encompasses various stages including data cleaning, data preprocessing, and modeling.

## Key Features
- Data Collection: Gathering a comprehensive dataset containing information about used cars, including features like mileage, year, make, model, condition, etc.
- Data Cleaning: The dataset undergoes thorough cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Data Preprocessing: Various preprocessing techniques are applied, such as feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and handling skewness.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the Linear Regression model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the parameters of the Linear Regression model to optimize its performance.
- Cross-Validation: Employing cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's generalizability and robustness.
- Interpretability: Analyzing the coefficients of the Linear Regression model to understand the impact of each feature on the predicted car prices.
- Deployment: Deploying the trained model using web frameworks or APIs to make it accessible for users to predict car prices based on their inputs.
- User Interface: Designing a user-friendly interface for users to input car features and view the predicted prices.
- Documentation: Providing comprehensive documentation explaining the project's methodology, code structure, and usage instructions.

## Usage
This model allows users to predict the price of a car based on input parameters. Users can input relevant features of the car, such as mileage, year, make, model, and condition, and the model will output the predicted price.
